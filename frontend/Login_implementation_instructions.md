If you want to allow users to create an account within your app while also providing the option to log in using credentials from third-party sources (like Google, Facebook, etc.), you can combine **OAuth 2.0** with your own **JWT-based authentication system**. Here’s how you can structure this combined approach:

### **1. OAuth 2.0 for Third-Party Authentication**

**Use Case:** Users who prefer to sign in using their existing accounts from Google, Facebook, or other OAuth 2.0 providers.

- **OAuth 2.0 Flow:** When a user chooses to log in with a third-party provider, your app will initiate the OAuth 2.0 flow. The user is redirected to the third-party provider, where they authenticate.
- **Access Token Retrieval:** Once authenticated, the third-party provider sends an authorization code back to your app. Your app exchanges this code for an access token (and optionally a refresh token) from the third-party provider.
- **User Information:** Use the access token to retrieve the user's information (such as email, name, profile picture) from the third-party provider.
- **User Account Creation:** If this is the first time the user is logging in with this third-party account, create a new user record in your database and link it to the provider’s user ID.
- **JWT Generation:** Generate a JWT for your own system, which the app will use for subsequent requests. This JWT can be issued after successful authentication via the third-party provider.

### **2. JWT Authentication for Local Accounts**

**Use Case:** Users who prefer to create an account directly within your app.

- **Account Creation:** Allow users to sign up using an email and password directly through your app. Store these credentials securely in your database (hashed and salted).
- **Login:** When a user logs in with their email and password, authenticate them by validating their credentials against your database.
- **JWT Issuance:** Once authenticated, issue a JWT that the app will use for subsequent requests.

### **3. Unifying the Authentication Process**

- **Single Authentication Endpoint:** Regardless of whether the user logs in via OAuth 2.0 or your local account system, unify the authentication process by issuing a JWT that your app uses to authorize API requests.
- **JWT Content:** Include information in the JWT that identifies the user and indicates whether they logged in via a third-party provider or directly through your app.
- **Refresh Tokens:** Implement refresh tokens for both types of users (OAuth and local) to keep them logged in without frequent re-authentication.

### **4. Handling the User Experience**

- **Login Screen:** Present users with the option to log in with third-party providers (e.g., "Login with Google") or to sign up/log in with their email and password.
- **Account Linking (Optional):** For users who might want to use both methods, provide an option in the account settings to link their third-party account to their local account. This can help in scenarios where a user initially signed up with email and later wants to add Google login as an option.

### **5. Security Considerations**

- **Token Storage:** Safeguard the JWTs and refresh tokens by storing them securely on the device (e.g., using the Secure Storage API).
- **Token Validation:** Ensure that JWTs are signed and validated properly on your backend to prevent unauthorized access.
- **User Data Protection:** Protect user data retrieved from third-party providers and handle it in compliance with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR).

### **Example Flow**

1. **User Chooses to Sign Up:**
   - **Local Account:** They enter their email and password, and your app creates a new account, issues a JWT, and logs them in.
   - **Third-Party:** They click on "Login with Google," complete the OAuth flow, and your app retrieves their user information, creates an account if necessary, issues a JWT, and logs them in.

2. **User is Logged In:**
   - All subsequent requests from the mobile app include the JWT in the Authorization header.
   - The server verifies the JWT, authenticates the user, and processes the request.

3. **Token Expiry:**
   - When the JWT expires, the app uses the refresh token (if implemented) to get a new JWT without requiring the user to log in again.

### **Tools and Libraries**

- **Spring Security:** To handle JWT generation and validation.
- **Spring Security OAuth2 Client:** To manage OAuth 2.0 authentication.
- **Third-Party SDKs:** Use SDKs provided by third-party providers (e.g., Google Sign-In) to streamline the OAuth 2.0 process.

### **Conclusion**

By combining OAuth 2.0 with your own JWT-based authentication, you offer users flexibility in how they log in while maintaining a unified and secure authentication mechanism across your app. This approach allows you to cater to users who prefer convenience (using existing accounts) and those who want to create a new account directly with your service.
